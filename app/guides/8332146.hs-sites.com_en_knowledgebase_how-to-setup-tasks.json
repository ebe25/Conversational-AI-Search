Say goodbye to endless follow-ups and hello to streamlined workflows and increased productivity. üëã\n\n#### How to setup Tasks\n\n1. To access the Tasks section, simply go to the top of the left-hand menu and select 'Tasks'.\n2. On the top right-hand corner select '+ Add new task'![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 10.21.19 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%2010.21.19%20AM.png?width=360&height=125&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%2010.21.19%20AM.png)\n3. Complete the 'Task Title' and description fields with clear and concise information.\n4. Next, decide the schedule for your task. Do you want it to run once or repeat?\n\n- Repeating tasks: A task scheduled for Fridays will be visible earlier in the week, allowing employees ample time to complete it. If a task is not completed by the deadline, it will automatically close, and the next available task will be displayed while we mark it as incomplete.\n- One-time tasks: These tasks can still be completed after the deadline\n\n**Tip**: Set up one-time tasks for promotions, such as setting up displays or signage for special events or holidays.\n\n**Editing Task Cadence:** Editing the schedule for one-time tasks is possible. However, editing the schedule for repeating tasks after publishing isn't possible. In this case, you will need to terminate/delete the task and create a new one.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 10.28.36 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%2010.28.36%20AM.png?width=615&height=398&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%2010.28.36%20AM.png)\n\n**Tip:**\n\n- For ongoing tasks tied to a specific job role, select 'Never' as the end date to ensure the task is always completed.\n- For seasonal tasks or those part of initial training, choose a custom end date or set the task to repeat a specific number of times.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 10.28.48 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%2010.28.48%20AM.png?width=609&height=499&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%2010.28.48%20AM.png)5\\. Choose optional 'Steps'.\n\nConsider this feature as a way to incorporate additional content from Delightree, like a form or chapter. View this step as a subtask - another item on the checklist to complete. ‚úÖ\n\n**Ways to use Steps:**\n\n- If you have a detailed chapter in your knowledge base on how to deep clean the ovens, you may want to include it here for a task specifically titled \"Deep clean ovens\".\n- Ensure that the repair request form is easily accessible to the assigned team member while they are completing the task of checking equipment.\n- Maybe your barista is conducting inventory checks and you'd like to provide them with a form to document any low stock items.\n\nThere are numerous ways to enhance the efficiency of your tasks using 'Steps'. Just keep in mind that you can only utilize existing chapters or forms, so make sure your content is prepared in advance. ‚úçÔ∏è\n\n6\\. Next, assign the task by selecting a team member, location, or job role. You have the flexibility to assign based on individual preferences or organizational roles.\n\n**Tip:** Assigning the task to a specific location can encourage teamwork among your staff, particularly useful for managing shift changes or team members with multiple responsibilities.\n\n7\\. Finally, include supervisors in the task. Keep in mind that superadmins are automatically designated as supervisors, giving them visibility into task progress and completion.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 10.59.39 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%2010.59.39%20AM.png?width=615&height=271&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%2010.59.39%20AM.png)\n\n**Tip:** To boost task completion rates, make sure to assign a supervisor to the task for effective monitoring of progress and completion.\n\n8\\. Hit 'Publish' and never have to worry about setting up this particular task again! üòÖ\n\n###### Was this article helpful?
