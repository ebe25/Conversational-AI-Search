Below is a detailed guide that explains how to create and use audits effectively, manage them, and stay on top of performance.\n\n### **1\\. Creating and Using Audit Templates**\n\nAudit templates are the foundation for running audits. These templates contain the questions you need to ask and can be tailored to what’s important for your business.\n\n#### **Steps to Create an Audit Template**:\n\n1. Go to the **Audits** module in Delightree’s main menu.\n2. Click on the **Drafts** tab at the top.\n3. Click **\\+ Create New Template** to start.\n4. Add your questions and answer choices:\n   - You can assign points to each answer for scoring later.\n   - Request evidence for specific answers (e.g., photos or documents).\n   - Flag certain answers if you want them to stand out in reports, like issues that need urgent attention.\n5. Click **Save**, and your template is ready to use in future audits.\n\n#### **Using Pre-made Templates**:\n\nIf you don’t want to start from scratch, you can use the **Template Library**. We’ve got templates for common audits like safety, cleanliness, and operations. You can use these as they are or customize them to fit your specific needs.\n\n### **2\\. How to Schedule an Audit**\n\nOnce you have your templates set up, scheduling an audit is simple.\n\n**Tip:** By scheduling recurring audits, you can easily compare the performance of all locations over time and spot trends that can help you improve!\n\n1. Go to the **Audits** tab.\n2. Click **Drafts,**\n3. Select an existing **template** from your library or create a new one. Click the three dots on the right-hand side and click to schedule.\n4. Set the **schedule** for the audit:\n\n   - Choose **one-time, weekly, or monthly** audits to ensure regular assessments.\n5. Assign **locations** and **auditors** for the audit.\n\n   - You can assign **multiple auditors** to a single location to split responsibility for completing the audit. This is particularly useful for larger locations or complex audits that require more manpower.\n6. Toggle the **Notify LO** (Location Owner) setting to inform Location Owners about upcoming audits.\n\n   - If you want the audit to remain a **surprise**, switch off the notification option so that Location Owners are unaware of the scheduled audit.\n7. Click **Save and Publish**, and the audit will go live.\n\n### **![Screenshot 2025-04-17 at 1.09.33 PM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screenshot%202025-04-17%20at%201.09.33%20PM.png?width=688&height=273&name=Screenshot%202025-04-17%20at%201.09.33%20PM.png)**\n\n### **3\\. Scoring in Audits**\n\nEach question in your audit can have a score, and this helps you track how well your locations are doing.\n\n#### **How Scoring Works**:\n\n1. When setting up a new template, assign points to each possible answer.\n   - Example: For “Is the dining area clean?” you could assign 10 points for “Yes” and 0 points for “No.”\n2. Once the audit is completed, Delightree will automatically calculate the total score based on the responses.\n3. You can review the final score in the audit report, which helps you monitor performance over time.\n\n\n\n#### **Flagging Responses:**\n\n\n   - **Flagging critical responses** allows auditors to highlight important issues (e.g., health violations, equipment malfunction) that require immediate attention. These flagged responses will be clearly visible in the audit report and will trigger alerts for the management team.\n\n### **4\\. Managing Audits Once They’re Live**\n\nSuperadmins, Admins, and Location Owners have varying levels of access and control over audits once they go live. Here's a more granular breakdown of how audits are managed:\n\n#### **Superadmin Capabilities:**\n\n-  Superadmins can edit a live-audit, i.e. they can modify questions, change the assigned auditors, or update locations.\n\n**Note**: Any unsaved work from auditors may be lost if changes are made mid-audit.\n- Temporarily halt an audit, ensuring it doesn’t appear on the auditor’s dashboard until resumed.\n- Any paused audit can be resumed at any time, even across different devices. Progress is saved automatically.\n- Superadmins can view the progress and results of all audits, including those they didn’t directly assign. They have access to a comprehensive view of audit results across all locations.\n\n#### **Admin Capabilities:**\n\nAdmins have more restricted access compared to Superadmins but still have control over their assigned locations. Admin access differs depending on whether they are assigned to the audit or only managing it.\n\n- **Admin Who is an Auditor**:\n\n  - Can **edit or pause** the audit they are assigned to.\n  - Can **view results** and flagged responses.\n- **Admin Who is Not an Auditor**:\n\n  - Can view the **progress** of audits for their assigned locations, but cannot edit or pause them.\n  - Can access **results and reports** post-audit to manage follow-up actions.\n\n#### **Location Owner (LO) Access:**\n\nLocation Owners can view audit results but have no ability to create or edit audits.\n\n- After an audit is completed, LOs can access their audit dashboard to see the overall score and flagged responses.\n- LOs can compare their location’s audit score against the company average and see where improvements are needed.\n- Any flagged issues requiring attention are clearly highlighted for LOs to review and address with their team.\n\n### **5\\. Surprise Audits**\n\nSurprise audits are unannounced audits, designed to assess how locations perform without prior preparation.\n\n#### **How to Set Up a Surprise Audit**:\n\n1. Start a new audit or choose an existing template.\n2. Assign auditors and select the locations to be audited.\n3. Toggle off the **“Notify LO”** option in the **Access** section, so Location Owners aren’t alerted ahead of time.\n4. After the audit is completed, Location Owners will receive notifications about the results, but not before.\n\n### **6\\. Superadmin Access**\n\nSuperadmins have oversight across all locations and audits.\n\n#### **What Superadmins Can Do**:\n\n- View all audits under the **Supervised by Me** tab.\n- Track audit progress across all locations, even those where they are not the direct auditor.\n- View **detailed reports**, including flagged responses and critical issues.\n- **Edit**, **pause**, or **delete** audits as necessary.\n- **Assign follow-up tasks** based on audit results to ensure issues are addressed in a timely manner.\n- Use **historical audit data** to identify trends in location performance over time and implement corrective actions where necessary.\n\n### **7\\. Admin Access**\n\nAdmins have less control than Superadmins but are responsible for their assigned locations.\n\n#### **What Admins Can Do**:\n\n- See audits they are assigned to under the **My Audits** tab.\n- **Create or edit templates** for future audits.\n- Start, continue, or pause audits in their locations.\n- **View scores and flagged issues** for completed audits.\n- Admins have full access to the audit progress and results but may have restricted permissions depending on their role (if they are also an auditor).\n\n### **8\\. Location Owner Access**\n\nLocation Owners can’t create or edit audits but can view the results once the audits are done.\n\n#### **What Location Owners Can Do**:\n\n- LOs can see the performance of their locations on their **Audit Dashboard** once an audit is complete.\n- LOs can compare their location’s scores with the overall company average to identify areas of improvement.\n- Any flagged responses (e.g., critical safety concerns) will be visible to LOs, allowing them to follow up with their teams.\n\n### **9\\. Notifications**\n\nDelightree makes sure everyone stays informed through notifications at every key point.\n\n#### **For Auditors**:\n\n- Notifications are sent when they’re assigned a new audit.\n- If an audit is updated or rescheduled, they’ll receive an alert.\n- Reminders will be sent before audits are due, based on the audit frequency.\n\n#### **For Location Owners**:\n\n- If the **Notify LO** option is switched on, Location Owners will get reminders about upcoming audits.\n- After an audit is completed for their location, they’ll be notified and can immediately access the results.\n\n### **11\\. Getting Started**\n\nReady to get going? Here’s what you need to do:\n\n- **Create Templates**: Use pre-made templates or create your own from scratch.\n- **Set Up Scoring**: Make sure you’ve assigned points to each question for clear performance tracking.\n- **Manage Audits**: Use the Audits module to monitor audits, assign follow-ups, and ensure your locations are performing as expected.\n\n###### Was this article helpful?
