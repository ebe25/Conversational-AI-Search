This ensures that everyone necessary is included in the project segment without manually adding them to each task.\n  - **Task-Specific Assignees:** Users can modify assignees for individual tasks which does not affect the overall phase assignees. This allows for specialized task management without disrupting the general workflow.\n\nTip: Adding a phase assignee overrides task assignees so assign phase assignees FIRST. For example, assign the phase to an internal team member, _then_ assign individual tasks of that phase to the location owner to make it collaborative.\n\n### **Phase & Task Management Enhancements**\n\n- **Unlock Dates and Dynamic Triggers:**\n\n![Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 10.33.41 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screenshot%202025-01-13%20at%2010.33.41%20AM.png?width=572&height=82&name=Screenshot%202025-01-13%20at%2010.33.41%20AM.png)\n\n\n\n  - Both phases and tasks can utilize dynamic triggers for their unlock dates and deadlines. These triggers can be set based on specific dates or dependent on the completion of preceding tasks or phases. For example, a task may unlock \"20 days after completion of another phase\" or \"upon the completion of a prior task,\" enhancing the adaptability of project timelines to real-time progress.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 10.35.37 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screenshot%202025-01-13%20at%2010.35.37%20AM.png?width=688&height=749&name=Screenshot%202025-01-13%20at%2010.35.37%20AM.png)\n- **Simplified Timing Rules:**\n\n- The time frame for each phase is defined by the difference between when the first task becomes active and when the last task is due.\n- It's important to note that a phase or task can have a custom unlock date, but not both simultaneously. If a phase is set with an unlock date, all tasks within that phase will automatically inherit this setting unless specified otherwise for individual tasks.\n- It is important to understand that a phase or task cannot have both a custom unlock date and a custom deadline date set at the same time. If you establish a custom unlock date, the default deadline will automatically be set to the project's go-live date. Conversely, if you set a custom deadline, the default unlock date will revert to the project's start date.\n\nNote: Estimated time for each task or phase is calculated by when the first task triggers _minus_ the last task's deadline. Please note that this is merely an estimate, as Delightree cannot determine when the task performer will complete the task.\n\n- **Categorization and Task Dependencies:**\n\n![Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 10.39.33 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screenshot%202025-01-13%20at%2010.39.33%20AM.png?width=688&height=875&name=Screenshot%202025-01-13%20at%2010.39.33%20AM.png)\n\n- **Customizable Views:** You can categorize tasks and phases based on their priorities and roles, which helps in segmenting the project into more manageable parts. This categorization supports better resource allocation and focus on varying project demands.\n- **Flexible Dependencies:** Tasks can have dependencies set, meaning the start of one task can depend on the completion of another, ensuring a logical flow of operations and preventing process bottlenecks.\n\nNote: Just a friendly reminder: Currently, the categories come pre-set, so creating your own isn't an option just yet.\n\n### **What You Can Expect ðŸ¤“**\n\n#### **Locations Currently In Launcher**\n\n1. **Default Board:**\n   - Your existing board will be automatically labeled as the â€˜Default Boardâ€™ in the new system.\n2. **Task Date Adjustments:**\n   - **Removal of Duration Field:** The â€˜durationâ€™ field will be removed to simplify task setup.\n   - **Activation Date:** By default, all tasks will activate on the project start date.\n   - **Deadline:** All tasks will have a default deadline set to the project's go-live date.\n   - **Dynamic Task Scheduling:** Tasks can now have dynamic activation and deadline dates that can be set based on the completion of preceding tasks or phases.\n3. **What is the same:**\n   - **Assignees:** All current assignees remain, ensuring continuity and minimizing the need for reassignments.\n   - **Dependencies:** Existing dependencies where tasks depend on the completion of previous tasks will be carried over to the new version.\n\n###### Was this article helpful?
