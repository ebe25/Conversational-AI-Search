Streamline your intake processes effortlessly by crafting forms in Delightree, whether you're building from the ground up or utilizing pre-existing templates.\n\nFollow these simple steps to create your first form in minutes. ‚úçÔ∏è\n\n1. Navigate to 'Forms & Checklists' under Resources on the left-hand side menu.\n2. Click on '+ Delightree Forms' on the top right-hand corner.\n3. Choose either to create from scratch or use an existing template.\n\n4. Fill out required fields like Form Title and your very first question.\n1. Choose from various question types such as short-text, paragraph, multiple choice, checkbox, or a dropdown list.\n5. Add options such as: tag a location, tag a member, record a video, take a picture, upload a file, or even add an acknowledgement.\n\n6. Include contributors if needed, then proceed to 'Publish'. üéä\n\nOnly Superadmins can view form responses by default, but you can add contributors to edit and view them.\n\n### Let's create a weekly cleaning checklist from scratch! üòÄ\n\n1. Begin by filling out the essential fields like Form Title and your first question.\n\n\n1. As you input information, your form will be displayed in the preview window on the right-hand side, giving you a glimpse of how it will look to the end-user.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-18 at 4.38.16 PM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-18%20at%204.38.16%20PM.png?width=622&height=450&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-18%20at%204.38.16%20PM.png)\n\n2\\. Now, let's give the assigned employee the option to upload an image of the patio area to confirm its cleanliness. We will do this by selecting 'Click Image'.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 8.37.20 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%208.37.20%20AM.png?width=561&height=109&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%208.37.20%20AM.png)\n\nAfter selecting the button, your form will now include the option below where you can provide a description or instructions for the image upload.\n\nThe 'Record Video' feature provides a similar experience, but with the added capability of capturing videos in real-time.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-18 at 4.58.33 PM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-18%20at%204.58.33%20PM.png?width=559&height=260&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-18%20at%204.58.33%20PM.png)\n\nWhen using this option in your form, the assigned employee will only have access to their camera, ensuring that the image taken is in real-time and up-to-date!\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 8.40.55 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%208.40.55%20AM.png?width=688&height=1173&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%208.40.55%20AM.png)\n\nThe preview window will now show the 'Open Camera' button to the assigned employee during form usage.\n\nIf you would like to provide the assigned employee with the flexibility to access files from their personal library or existing documents, you can opt for 'File Upload' instead.\n\n3\\. Once you're finished editing your form, you can choose to add contributors.\n\nAs illustrated below, contributors are granted access to edit, delete, publish, and view all form responses.\n\nThis feature is perfect for managers or supervisors who are overseeing this form but do not have super admin access in the system.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 9.03.30 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%209.03.30%20AM.png?width=605&height=425&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%209.03.30%20AM.png)\n\n4\\. Review your form and when you're ready, click on 'Publish'! Before making the form available, you can choose to set the visibility to Public, for all users on Delightree, or customize the visibility settings.\n\nCustom visibility allows you to tailor the form's availability based on specific locations, job roles, or even individual users.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 9.09.16 AM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%209.09.16%20AM.png?width=566&height=568&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%209.09.16%20AM.png)5\\.
