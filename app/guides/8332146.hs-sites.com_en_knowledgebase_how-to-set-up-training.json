Follow these steps to learn how. üëá**\n\n1. Go to the Training section located under 'Resources' in the menu on the left-hand side.\n2. Click on the option 'Add New Path' located at the top right corner.\n3. Choose a unique name for your training path and start adding content.\n\n\n1. Browse through the knowledge base to find chapters to include in your training path. Use the funnel icon to easily filter and select content from a specific folder.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 2.27.11 PM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%202.27.11%20PM.png?width=688&height=291&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%202.27.11%20PM.png)\n\n4\\. After adding chapters, you can add in a power-up to create more engagement and interaction.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 2.36.37 PM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%202.36.37%20PM.png?width=356&height=341&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%202.36.37%20PM.png)\n\nTip: Actions like video viewing, form completion, and quizzes ensure active participation and enhance learning outcomes making training enjoyable for employees while boosting knowledge retention. Win-win! üëè\n\n**Here are some ways to incorporate power-ups:**\n\n- During in-store training sessions, utilize **'Action' cards**to prompt trainees to complete specific tasks. For instance, in barista training, a task could involve preparing a matcha latte.\n- For bartender training, consider incorporating brief **videos** demonstrating the preparation of specific craft cocktails. Remember to keep the videos short to maintain engagement.\n- **Milestones** are an excellent method to support your team members in acknowledging the significant progress they are achieving. Additionally, milestones aid in breaking down the training into easily digestible sections.\n- Utilize your team's existing **forms** to gather extra details or offer a checklist for trainees to complete. For instance, for new team members, consider using a 'Get to Know Me' form to gather information about your new hire and help build team camaraderie.\n- After guiding your team members through a few chapters, it's a fantastic opportunity to encourage them to take a quick **quiz** to reinforce their understanding and retention of the material.\n\nüí°The purpose of a quiz during training is to support the trainee in learning and understanding the material. Therefore, quiz results are not recorded, and trainees are not penalized for incorrect answers. Instead, the quiz prompts them to keep trying until they find the correct answer.\n\n5\\. Once your training path is created, select 'Save & Next'.\n\n6\\. This is where you designate the training to a specific job role. For instance, assign barista training to the 'barista' job role.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 3.13.14 PM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%203.13.14%20PM.png?width=574&height=177&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%203.13.14%20PM.png)\n\nSimplify the onboarding process! Whenever a new user is added, they will automatically be enrolled in training tailored to their job role. Whether it's a promotion or job role change, rest assured that these users will also be included.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-19 at 3.11.45 PM](https://8332146.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/8332146/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%203.11.45%20PM.png?width=688&height=791&name=Screen%20Shot%202024-03-19%20at%203.11.45%20PM.png)\n\nAssigning training to specific locations or team members can be particularly beneficial.\n\nThis approach is especially useful when tailoring training to a specific promotional event or when implementing significant changes within your brand that you want all team members to be well-informed about.\n\n7\\. Next, you will designate supervisors to oversee and track progress for this training. In their role as supervisors, they have visibility into results and can send reminders. Additionally, as previously noted, all superadmins are supervisors by default.\n\n8\\. When you're ready, click on 'Publish' and select whether you want this training path to be Public (accessible to all users) or Private (only users assigned to this training can access and view it).\n\nAnd there you have it! Your training path has been successfully created! üéä\n\n###### Was this article helpful?
